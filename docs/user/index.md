## Presentation of the project

Junqo is a solution designed to help young people find internships and work-study programs.  

Three main problems can be identified: lack of follow-up, complexity of the search and lack of visibility.
Junqo aims to support young people throughout the search process. To this end, assistance based on AI models will be made available.
For example, an interview simulator will be available, as well as assistance with CV writing.  

Students aren't the only ones targeted. Junqo also targets small businesses struggling to find a place in the job market. Our business model and our policy of publishing internship offers give the 10-employee startup as much visibility as the multinational.  

As far as the search is concerned, an advanced algorithm will only suggest what really corresponds to you. Only the necessary information is displayed. The aim is to save time and simplify the process.  

In order to facilitate access to the platform for as many people as possible, Junqo is intended to be both a mobile application and a web platform.
